# Web Visualization Dashboard
Created the *Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard* using HTML and CSS. Based on our analysis we can come to the following conclusion:
**Temperature**: The temperature tends to increase towards the equator (0 Deg. Lattitude), there are certain outliers between latitude 20 to 40 degrees but that can be attributed to other environmental factors like the numerous deserts in northern Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.
**Humidity**: For cities whose latitude lies between -20 to 20 degrees, we observe that the humidity is very high (more than 60%).
**Cloudiness**: Based on the data cloudiness and latitude cannot be correlated. Thus cloudiness is independent of latitude.
**Wind Speed**: Based on the data, wind speed and latitude cannot be correlated. Thus wind speed is independent of latitude.
